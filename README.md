# pytorch gym
learn pytorch by some tutorials for learning group.

## first step

> Variable and Autograd

> construct the regression model by Linear class

> construct the softmax model or logistic regression by pytorch

> cnn

    1. cnn for mnist

    2. find best image for trained cnn

> rnn and lstm

    1. rnn for mnist

    2. create poetry by rnn and lstm, including embeding and bidirection rnn or lstm

> bidirectional lstm
