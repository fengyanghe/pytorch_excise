# pytorch gym
learn pytorch by some tutorials for learning group.

## first step

### Variable and Autograd

### construct the regression model by Linear class

### construct the softmax model or logistic regression by pytorch

### cnn

    1. cnn for mnist

    2. find best image for trained cnn

### tsne: implement tsne by pytorch 

    necessary for tensorboardx support, pip install tensorboardX

### autoencoder

    the basic auto encoder used conv and deconv 

### rnn and lstm

    1. rnn for mnist

    2. create poetry by rnn and lstm, including embeding and bidirection rnn or lstm

### bidirectional lstm
